title: Galaxy on the Cloud Documentation

## Cloud ecosystem

Running Galaxy on the cloud in a scalable manner requires a robust platform
that is composed of multiple pieces of software. This page explains the pieces
involved and provides links to additional documentation.

For the end user, the process of obtaining access to a Galaxy instance is quite
straightforward and should only take a few minutes. The process consists of:
 0. Obtain credentials for the desired cloud provider;
 1. Launching an appliance (i.e., a flavor of Galaxy) on a desired cloud
    provider, via the CloudLaunch application;
 2. Wait for the necessary application services to start on the newly launched
    virtual machine and start using Galaxy.
